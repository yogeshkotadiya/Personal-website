# Draft (writing under progress...)

As you know React Team just last week released most-awaited React Hooks API. React Hooks allows us to write Stateful functional Components by using hooks API and also you can create your own Custom Hooks that you can share across many components.

Today we going to look into some of the different hooks and see how they compare to traditional Class based components. I'm not going to dive deep into how they work under the hood. For that, I recommend you to read Dan's Personal Blog [Overreacted](https://overreacted.io).

Let's get started but before we start I hope you have a bit of experience with React.

# useState() Hook

So to get started with things we'll do something simple use of [useState()](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usestate) for Creating and mutating state.

```js highlight=2-5,9
class App extends React.Component{
  contructor(props){
    super(props);
    this.name = "Yogesh";
    this.handleNameChange= this.handleNameChange.bind(this);
    // ‚úÖ We have to bind 'this' for method to work.
  }
  handleNameChange(event){
    this.setState(name: event.target.value);
  }

  render(){
    return (
      <div>
        <input
          type="text"
          value={this.state.name}
          onChange={this.handleNameChange} />
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

In the above code block we contructed a simple class based Stateful component with name property in it.
And also a input tag with onChnage handler to mutate the state value.

Now let's try the above example with Hooks.

```js highlight=2,6
function App() {
  const [name, setName] = React.useState("Yogesh");
  // Here we declare the state and pass a initial value.

  function handleNameChange(event) {
    setName(event.target.value);
  }
  return (
    <div>
      <input
        type="text"
        value={this.state.name}
        onChange={this.handleNameChange}
      />
    </div> //You can also write method inline using arrow function
  );
}
```

As you can see using new hooks method not only made our code cleaner but easier to understand.

# So what exactly happened?üßê

As you can see using 'useState' hook API we can manage state easily without writing too much overhead like Contructor and you don't have to worry about binding 'this' as we are using functional components this makes our code clean and easy to understand.
One caveat with Hooks is that you can not use hooks API outside function component. But maybe this is design choice to make Application more secure.
