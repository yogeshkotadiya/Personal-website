React Hooks allows us to write Stateful functional Components by using functions called hooks provided by React and you can create your own custom Hooks that you can share across many components.

In this article we are going to look into some of the different hooks and see how they compare to traditional Class based components.

Let's get started but before we start I hope you have a bit of experience with React and Component lifecycles.

# useState() Hook

So to get started with things we'll do something simple use of [useState()](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usestate) for Creating and mutating state.

---

```jsx highlight=2-5,9
class App extends React.Component{
  contructor(props){
    super(props);
    this.name = "Yogesh";
    this.handleNameChange= this.handleNameChange.bind(this);
    // ‚úÖ We have to bind 'this' for method to work.
  }
  handleNameChange(event){
    this.setState(name: event.target.value);
  }

  render(){
    return (
      <div>
        <input
          type="text"
          value={this.state.name}
          onChange={this.handleNameChange} />
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

In the above code block we contructed a simple class based Stateful component with name property in it.
And also a input tag with onChnage handler to mutate the state value.

Now let's try the above example with Hooks.

```jsx highlight=2,6
function App() {
  const [name, setName] = useState("Yogesh");
  // Here we declare the state and pass a initial value.

  function handleNameChange(event) {
    setName(event.target.value);
  }
  return (
    <div>
      <input
        type="text"
        value={this.state.name}
        onChange={this.handleNameChange}
      />
    </div> //You can also write method inline using arrow function
  );
}
```

As you can see using new hooks method not only made our code cleaner but easier to understand.
You can use as many as hooks you want in a single functional component.
Just make sure you are not calling hooks in nested conditional body.

```jsx
function App(props) {
  if (props.isValid) {
    const [name, setName] = useState("Yogesh");
    // ‚ùå You can't use hooks in conditional statement
  }
  const [name, setName] = useState("Yogesh");
  // ‚úî Use Hooks in function body only.

  function handleNameChange(event) {
    setName(event.target.value);
  }
  return (
    <div>
      <input
        type="text"
        value={this.state.name}
        onChange={this.handleNameChange}
      />
    </div> //You can also write method inline using arrow function
  );
}
```

> Note: Hook can only be called inside a functional body because react keeps tracks of all hooks calls in component to determine which hook to run when condition is met so putting hook into condtional will break the call track.
